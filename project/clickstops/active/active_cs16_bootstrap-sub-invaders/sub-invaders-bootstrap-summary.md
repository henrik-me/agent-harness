## Bootstrap operations performed

1. `gh repo create henrik-me/sub-invaders --public --license=MIT --description="Sea-themed Space Invaders, governed by agent-harness; first non-self-host consumer."`
2. `git clone https://github.com/henrik-me/sub-invaders C:\src\sub-invaders`
3. `npx -y "github:henrik-me/agent-harness#v0.2.0" init --constraint-disposition=flip-public-when-ready --with-scaffold=feature-flags --with-scaffold=verify-deploy --with-scaffold=container-validate --with-scaffold=seed --with-scaffold=health-check`
   - Exit 0, but emitted two warnings (see Findings #1 below).
4. **Workaround for ajv issue:** `npm install --no-save ajv ajv-formats js-yaml` into the npx cache directory `C:\Users\henri\AppData\Local\npm-cache\_npx\e35f86be63b12545`.
5. `npx -y "github:henrik-me/agent-harness#v0.2.0" sync --mode=apply` — 3 changes applied (composed file generation: `CONVENTIONS.md`, `OPERATIONS.md`, `REVIEWS.md`).
6. Stubbed `flags/flags.json` to `flags: []` (template defaults had expired 2025 dates; see Finding #5).
7. Removed stray root-level `.gitkeep` (see Finding #6).
8. Created folder skeleton: `src/engine/`, `src/game/`, `api/`, `infra/` (`.gitkeep` only — no source code per CS16 scope refinement).
9. Copied 6 SI-CS planned files from `project/clickstops/active/active_cs16_bootstrap-sub-invaders/si-cs-plans/` (this repo) → `project/clickstops/planned/` (sub-invaders).

## Harness-monitor findings (filed for follow-up agent-harness CSs)

These are real issues observed during the very first downstream-consumer `harness init` from a fresh public repo. Per the CS16 master plan Decision #21, harness fixes land as separate harness CSs — not in-band.

### Finding #1 — CRITICAL: `ajv` is a devDependency in agent-harness `package.json`

When `npx -y "github:henrik-me/agent-harness#v0.2.0"` installs the package, only `dependencies` are installed (which are `null` in the published v0.2.0). `ajv`, `ajv-formats`, and `js-yaml` are declared in `devDependencies` and therefore are NOT present at runtime. The init script attempts to load ajv for constraint-merge and post-init sync; both silently fail with `Cannot find package 'ajv'`.

**Symptoms observed during sub-invaders init:**

\\\
Warning: could not merge constraints into harness.config.json: Cannot find package 'ajv' imported from C:\Users\henri\AppData\Local\npm-cache\_npx\e35f86be63b12545\node_modules\@henrik-me\agent-harness\lib\config-reader.mjs
...
Warning: post-init sync failed: Cannot find package 'ajv' imported from C:\Users\henri\AppData\Local\npm-cache\_npx\e35f86be63b12545\node_modules\@henrik-me\agent-harness\lib\sync.mjs
Run \harness sync --mode=apply\ manually to complete setup.
\\\

**Workaround applied:** `npm install --no-save ajv ajv-formats js-yaml` into the npx cache dir before re-invoking sync. Brittle (cache may be wiped at any time) and requires manual user intervention every fresh install.

**Recommended fix:** move `ajv`, `ajv-formats`, `js-yaml` from `devDependencies` to `dependencies` in agent-harness `package.json`, cut a `v0.2.1` patch release, recommend consumers update pin.

**Impact:** every fresh consumer init via npx git ref hits this. Likely the same friction will hit any subsequent sync invocation that loads ajv. Self-host (running directly from `C:\src\agent-harness`) is unaffected because the local `npm install` populates devDependencies.

### Finding #2 — HIGH: `harness.config.json` `version` field hardcoded to `v0.1.0`

The init template seeds `harness.config.json` with `"version": "v0.1.0"` regardless of the version actually invoked. Even when invoked at `v0.2.0` ref, the seeded config records `v0.1.0`. Consumer must manually edit.

**Recommended fix:** at init time, detect the invocation ref (from `process.argv` parsing or `__dirname` resolution back to the git ref) and seed the actually-invoked version. Or, render `"version"` as a placeholder `REPLACE_ME` and require the user to set it.

### Finding #3 — HIGH: `harness.config.json` seeded with `REPLACE_ME` placeholders that lint does not detect

Init seeds:

\\\json
"project": { "name": "my-project", "agent_suffix": "mp", "repo": "REPLACE_ME/REPLACE_ME" },
"templating": { "repo_owner": "REPLACE_ME", "default_codeowner": "REPLACE_ME", "lib_codeowner": "REPLACE_ME", "repo_short": "REPLACE_ME" }
\\\

These placeholders pass through composed-block rendering and end up as literal text in CONVENTIONS.md, OPERATIONS.md, REVIEWS.md. `harness lint` does not flag them.

**Recommended fix:** add a `check-config-placeholders` linter that scans `harness.config.json` (and rendered composed files) for literal `REPLACE_ME` and fails. SI-CS01 will replace these for sub-invaders, but the gap is real.

### Finding #4 — HIGH: `.harness-lock.json` records `"unknown"` and `"0000..."` for npx-git-ref invocations

After `sync --mode=apply`, `.harness-lock.json` contains:

\\\json
"harness_ref": "unknown",
"resolved_sha": "0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
"scaffolds": [{"name": "feature-flags", "version": "unknown"}, ...]
\\\

This defeats the entire pin-integrity verification mechanism. Consumers can't validate they're synced against the expected harness version.

**Recommended fix:** when sync runs from an npx-installed package, read the package's git ref from the npx cache metadata (`npm-cache/_npx/<hash>/node_modules/.package-lock.json` typically records the ref) and populate `harness_ref` + `resolved_sha` accordingly.

### Finding #5 — MEDIUM: Seeded `flags/flags.json` has expired example dates causing day-1 lint fail

The seeded template ships with `"expires": "2025-12-31"` and `"expires": "2025-06-30"` example flags. By the time any consumer runs init in 2026+, the policy linter immediately fails with `STALE — "expires" date YYYY-MM-DD is in the past`.

**Recommended fix:** either (a) seed with all-future dates auto-computed at init time (e.g. `today + 90 days`), (b) seed with `expires: null`, or (c) seed with a comment-only file (no example flags). Stubbed to empty for sub-invaders.

### Finding #6 — MEDIUM: Stray `.gitkeep` created at repo root by harness init

Init created a file literally named `.gitkeep` at the consumer repo root. `.gitkeep` files are conventionally only used inside otherwise-empty subdirectories to force git to track them. A root-level `.gitkeep` is meaningless and clutter.

**Recommended fix:** remove the `Created .gitkeep` line in init's file-creation script (the loop is likely seeding `.gitkeep` inside `./`).

### Finding #7 — LOW: Sync warns "WORKBOARD.md has active CS rows" on fresh consumer

The warning string `WORKBOARD.md has active CS rows. Syncing mid-CS may cause process-shape changes mid-flight.` triggers on the seeded WORKBOARD's placeholder Orchestrators row (`_(placeholder — replace with real agent)_`) which pattern-matches the active-row detector. False positive on any first-sync of a freshly-init'd repo.

**Recommended fix:** tighten the active-row detector to ignore rows where every cell is a placeholder string.

### Finding #8 — LOW: Several `harness lint` checks "skipped (target not found)" without informing consumer they should consider adopting them

Lint skipped: `instructions`, `fixtures`, `templates`, `pack`, `scaffold-readme`, `public-artifact`, `pr-body`, `commit-trailers`, `compose-v2`. Several of these (notably `commit-trailers`, `pr-body`) are checks every consumer SHOULD have once they have PRs and commits. Silent skip means a consumer never learns they exist.

**Recommended fix:** for at-least the consumer-applicable checks (`commit-trailers`, `pr-body`), emit an informational note recommending the consumer add the prerequisite file (e.g. `.github/pull_request_template.md`).

### Finding #9 — LOW: No `.gitattributes` seeded; Windows consumers see CRLF round-trip warnings

Sub-invaders has no `.gitattributes`. Windows `git` with default `core.autocrlf=true` immediately surfaces 32 `LF will be replaced by CRLF the next time Git touches it` warnings at first commit. Confusing for new consumers.

**Recommended fix:** harness init should seed a `.gitattributes` with `* text=auto eol=lf` (matching the harness's own LF discipline). SI-CS01 will add this for sub-invaders.

## Recommended follow-up agent-harness CSs (for the workboard)

- **CS25 (proposed)**: Move `ajv`/`ajv-formats`/`js-yaml` from devDependencies to dependencies; cut v0.2.1 patch (Finding #1).
- **CS26 (proposed)**: `harness init` improvements bundle: detect-and-seed actual version (Finding #2); add `check-config-placeholders` linter (Finding #3); npx-cache-aware `.harness-lock.json` population (Finding #4); seed `flags.json` with computed-future dates or empty (Finding #5); skip stray root `.gitkeep` (Finding #6); seed `.gitattributes` (Finding #9).
- **CS27 (proposed)**: Tighten WORKBOARD active-row detector to ignore placeholder rows (Finding #7); informational notes for skip-able lints (Finding #8).

(CS25 is the highest-priority follow-up — every fresh consumer install is impacted today.)
