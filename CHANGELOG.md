## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-04

Initial private-tier release. The harness governs itself (CS11 self-host) and is
ready for invitation-only consumers via `npx -y github:henrik-me/agent-harness#v0.1.0`.

### Added
- `bin/harness.mjs` — CLI dispatcher with subcommands: `init`, `sync`, `lint`,
  `pack`, `whoami`, `version`, `help` (CS04+).
- `lib/sync.mjs`, `lib/composed.mjs`, `lib/templating.mjs`, `lib/lock.mjs`,
  `lib/doc-schema.mjs` — sync engine, composed-blocks merge, templating with
  capture-group guard + escape syntax, lock read/write, shared doc parsing
  (CS03 + CS03b + CS05).
- 15 linters wired into `harness lint --quiet` aggregator (CS05–CS13):
  learnings, context, workboard, architecture, clickstop, instructions,
  readme, composed-blocks, workflow-pins, text-encoding, fixtures, pack
  (self-host-guarded), public-artifact, pr-body, commit-trailers,
  compose-v2, render-deploy-summary.
- 8 scaffold bundles via `harness init --with-scaffold <name>` (CS10):
  smoke, migrations, container-validate, health-check, seed, verify-deploy,
  feature-flags, cs-probes.
- 7 managed + 3 composed process-doc templates (CS08); `harness init`
  produces a fully linter-passing consumer repo from a single command (CS09).
- Reusable GitHub workflow `harness-checks.yml` (`workflow_call`) +
  drift-detection template `harness-drift.yml` (weekly auto-PR) (CS12).
- npm packaging readiness: `check-pack.mjs` validates tarball shape against
  forbidden patterns + required entries + size budget (CS13).
- Tag-triggered release workflow + private-consumption smoke test (CS14, this release).

### Security
- All GitHub Actions workflows pass externally-influenced values through
  `env:` and validate against an allowlist regex before shell consumption
  (LRN-075). Defence-in-depth against shell injection.
- `check-public-artifact` linter blocks accidental publication of secrets
  (GitHub PAT, AWS keys) and forbidden internal URLs (CS06).

### Documentation
- README, INSTRUCTIONS, OPERATIONS, CONVENTIONS, REVIEWS, TRACKING,
  RETROSPECTIVES — managed via `harness sync` from `template/managed/` +
  `template/composed/`. CS01 → CS11 evolution.
- CONTEXT, ARCHITECTURE, LEARNINGS (77 entries), WORKBOARD — seeded
  project-state docs.
