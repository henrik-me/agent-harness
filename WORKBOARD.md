## Orchestrators

Status vocabulary: `🟢 Active` (Last Seen within 24h), `🟡 Idle` (24h-7d), `⚪ Offline` (>7d). Agent-ID derivation per [TRACKING.md § Agent Identification](TRACKING.md#agent-identification).

| Agent ID | Machine | Repo Folder | Status | Last Seen |

## Active Work

<!--
Active Work table accepts two empty forms (see template/seeded/WORKBOARD.md):
  (a) header-only — keep header + separator rows ONLY (form below)
  (b) em-dash placeholder — single data row with "no active CS" in Title cell
Do NOT use `_(none)_` placeholder rows — `check-workboard.mjs` will reject them.
-->

| CS-Task ID | Title | State | Owner | Branch | Last Updated | Blocked Reason |

| CS47 | detached-HEAD investigation (LRN-124) | 🟢 Active | yoga-ah | cs47/content | 2026-06-04 | — |

> **Note:** WORKBOARD shows live coordination state only — active orchestrators and their active work. The queue lives in `project/clickstops/planned/` (priority via filename + per-file `**Depends on:**`); historical record lives in `project/clickstops/done/`. Do not duplicate either here.
